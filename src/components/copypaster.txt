           Welcome to the exciting world of front-end development and the Design Hackathon! In this fast-paced and creative event, participants will have the opportunity to showcase their skills, unleash their imagination, and collaborate with like-minded individuals to create innovative and visually stunning user interfaces.</p>
<p>
Organized by Website Development and Management Club, this hackathon is specifically focused on front-end development using react.js, where participants will be challenged to design and build interactive conference website. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer eager to learn and explore, this event promises to be a thrilling experience for all.
</p><p>
One of the unique aspects of this hackathon is the provision of pre-defined routes. These routes serve as guidelines and inspire participants to think outside the box while working within a specific theme of developing a conference website. The organizing team has carefully curated a set of routes, ensuring all the requirements of the conference site.
</p><p>
Throughout the hackathon, participants will have access to a wide range of resources, including mentorship sessions, feedback on design and help desk to clarify any doubts . This support system will empower participants to overcome challenges, refine their designs, and create remarkable front-end experiences.
</p><p>
The Design Hackathon is not just a competition with prize money; it's an opportunity to network, learn, and grow in a collaborative environment. Participants will have the chance to connect with fellow designers, and developers, opening doors to potential recruitment to the NITJ development cell (to be formed under WDM-club) where you will be paid for your work. This is a unique opportunity that a student will get at NITJ to contribute to the institute and also to earn while you learn!
</p><p>
So, whether you're a visionary designer, a coding wizard, or an aspiring front-end developer, join us for this thrilling Design Hackathon. Let your creativity soar, embrace the challenges, and showcase your skills as you redefine the boundaries of front-end development. Get ready to embark on an unforgettable journey of design, innovation, and camaraderie!
